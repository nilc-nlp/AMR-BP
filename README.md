## Corpus notation

The corpora follow a standard notation to ease the reading of files. A corpus file contains multiple sentences, each with some metainformation, which starts with a hashtag followed by double colons (# ::) and a keyword (id, snt, alignment...). Then, the AMR graph representation in the PENMAN notation is written. An example is shown below:

```
# ::id Fala-Serio-Mae.Documento_32.1
# ::snt Amei esse livro .
(a / amar-01
      :ARG0 (e2 / eu)
      :ARG1 (l / livro
            :mod (e3 / esse)))
```

A blank line separates each sentence.
