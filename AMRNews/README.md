# AMRNews

This is AMRNews, an AMR annotated corpus of journalistic texts in Brazilian Portuguese. Sentences come from news texts belonging to the Folha de SÃ£o Paulo and PropBank.Br.

## Corpus

The corpus is organized in a single file [`amr.txt`](unsplit/amr.txt) with multiple sentences. Each sentence is separated by a blank line. Additionally, the folder [`split`](split) contains the same corpus divided in training, development and test sets in order to allow experiments in Natural Language Generation and Semantic Parsing.
